1. Describe the general clustering problem in terms of the (1)
   dimensions and (2) range of values, for both the (a) inputs and the
   (b) outputs of a clustering algorithm.

2. Assuming there are some gold standard labels available, explain how
   the labels can be used to quantitatively evaluate a clustering
   algorithm. What value(s) do you compute, and how do you interpret
   them? Do larger or smaller values indicate a more accurate clustering?

3. Explain the K-means algorithm in terms of the input/initialization,
   computations during each iteration, when to stop, and what values to output/return.

4. Explain the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm in
   terms of the input/initialization (including hyper-parameter
   choices), computations required, when to stop, and what values to
   output/return.

5. What is model selection? Explain how cross-validation (e.g., a 50%
   train, 50% validation split) can be used for clustering model
   selection.

Rubric: minus points for incomplete and/or off-topic responses.

Volunteers to present solutions:
- CS499: Georgia, Brendan, Taylor, Kyler, Samantha.
- CS599: TODO.

For the real mid-term on Friday Oct 1 at 8:00AM-8:50AM, what would be
the analogous questions for the other topics that we have studied?
