1. What input data and hyper-parameter(s) are required as input to the
   binary segmentation algorithm? What does the algorithm output?

2. Consider a sequential data set with N=100 data points. To compute
   the binary segmentation model with 1/2/3 changepoints, what is the
   number of splits for which the loss must be computed? (provide best
   and worst case analysis)

3. Consider a sequential data set with N=100 data points. To compute
   the optimal segmentation model with S=4 segments we can use the
   classic dynamic programming to recursively compute the best loss
   values L_{s,t} in s segments and t data points. For each of the
   following loss values, how many last changepoint variables are
   considered?
   - L_{2,50}
   - L_{3,10}
   - L_{4,100}

4. Are the following statements true or false for each of the
   segmentation/changepoint learning algorithms that we have studied?
   - Guaranteed to compute the globally optimal model for some model
     sizes.
   - Guaranteed to compute the globally optimal model for all model
     sizes.
   - Guaranteed to compute the globally optimal model for no model
     sizes.
   - Learned model parameters depend on random initialization.
   - Time complexity is linear in number of data.
   - Time complexity is linear in model size.

5. Assume you have a time series of with P=2 dimensions that you want
   to segment using a Hidden Markov Model. Assume a multivariate
   normal emission distribution with no constraints on the covariance
   matrix. Also assume there are S=5 states, and a dense transition
   matrix (no constraints). What are the model parameters, what are
   their sizes/dimensions, and how many of each are there?

Rubric: minus points for incomplete and/or off-topic responses.

Volunteers to present solutions:
- CS499: Georgia, Taylor, Brendan, Charlie, Austin.
- CS599: TODO

For the real mid-term (in class at time shown below), what would be
the analogous questions for the other topics that we have studied?
- CS599 Thurs Nov 4 at 8:00AM-9:15AM.
- CS499 Friday Nov 5 at 8:00AM-8:50AM.

It will be open-note: during the real exam, you are allowed one sheet
of paper, filled in with your own notes, in your own handwriting.
