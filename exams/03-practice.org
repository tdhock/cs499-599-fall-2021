1. A common theme in unsupervised learning algorithms is a goal of
   finding a model with "best fit" to the data. In probabilistic
   models such as Gaussian Mixtures and Hidden Markov models, the goal
   is minimizing the negative log likelihood. In non-probabilistic
   models such as Principal components analysis and k-means the goal
   is to minimize the mean squared error. In general we use the term
   "loss function" to describe the measure of difference between model
   and data (smaller loss values indicate better model fit). In all
   models there is a model size/complexity hyper-parameter which
   controls the extent to which the model can fit the data.

    For the four models discussed above, what is the model size
       hyper-parameter?

    Does the loss with respect to the train set increase or decrease
       as model size increases?

    Does underfitting happen for large or small model sizes? Why
       should underfitting be avoided?

    Does overfitting happen for large or small model sizes? Why should
       overfitting be avoided?

2. Assume you have a scaled data matrix with N=1000 rows/observations
   and P=500 columns/features, and you want a 2-dimensional embedding
   to visualize these data on a scatterplot. Consider a fully
   connected autoencoder with only dense weight matrices (no
   intercept/bias) and number of units per layer
   (500,100,10,2,10,100,500). How many parameters are there to infer
   in the autoencoder, and in a PCA? What algorithms can you use to
   compute model parameters in PCA and in the autoencoder? After
   computing the model parameters, how can you use them to compute the
   low-dimensional embedding of the data for visualization on a
   scatterplot?

3. Explain in detail the similarities and differences between Gaussian
   Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models.

    What kinds of data are used as inputs?

    What hyper-parameter(s) must be fixed before running the EM
       algorithm?

    What are the names and sizes of the model parameters that are
       learned using the EM algorithm?

    How many of each parameter are there?

    How do the inference algorithms work? What happens to the
       parameters in the E and M steps?

4. The changepoint algorithms we have studied have very different
   asymptotic time complexity, in terms of number of data in the
   sequence N, and number of clusters/states K. For each of the
   following scenarios, use big O notation to either (1) explain which
   algorithm would be fastest and mention at least one other algorithm
   which would be slower, or (2) explain why all algorithms would have
   similar speed.
   - large N.
   - large K.

5. Consider a sequential data set with N=400 data points. To compute
   the binary segmentation model with 1/2/3/4 changepoints, what is
   the number of splits for which the loss must be computed? (provide
   best and worst case analysis)
   
Rubric: minus points for incomplete and/or off-topic responses.
