The goal of this homework is to get experience interpreting and
evaluating the quality of some other dimensionality reduction
algorithms.

1. first select 100 rows of the zip.train data from the ESL book (10
   from each class), and save the resulting inputs in a matrix, and
   the class/labels (first column) in a vector.

2. Write a for loop over three different dimensionality reduction
   methods implemented in the dimRed R package. In each iteration you
   should use dimRed::embed to compute the low-dimensional embedding
   using one of those methods for your input matrix. During each
   iteration save the low dimensional embedding in a data table, then
   after the for loop combine all of the data tables into a single
   data table for plotting. Make a ggplot which shows the two
   embedding dimensions on the x/y axes, the different class/labels as
   different numbers (geom_text), and the different methods in
   different panels (facet_grid). Which of the three methods appears
   to separate the class labels the best, in your opinion?

3. Choose three different quality scores implemented in the dimRed R
   package. For each quality score and embedding method, compute the
   quality score and save it in a matrix (rows for methods, columns
   for scores). Make sure the matrix has row and column names, then
   print it out. For each quality score, which method is best?

For the CS599 grad students, no extra assignment this week. For extra
credit, you may start a third [[file:Rpkg.org][R package coding project]].
