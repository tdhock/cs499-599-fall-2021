R package coding project for CS599 graduate students ONLY

The goal of this project is to provide you with experience in
testing/documenting/distributing your code as a free/open-source R
package, as well as writing efficient C/C++ code.

To figure out how to write an R package, you can read the free
online book [[https://r-pkgs.org/][R packages]].

You need at least two algorithms from previous coding projects to
include in your R package.
- First project: choose from KMEANS, GMM, HCLUST.
- Second project: include BINSEG and DYNPROG.
- Third project: code PCA in C++ using either RcppEigen or
  RcppArmadillo.

For each function you need to
- provide documentation that includes example code that shows how to
  use it. You can either [[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Rd-format][write the Rd files yourself]], or use a
  documentation generation system like [[https://r-pkgs.org/man.html][roxygen2]]/[[http://inlinedocs.r-forge.r-project.org/][inlinedocs]].
- write at least one [[https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html][test]] to make sure it returns a reasonable result
  (e.g. it returns an integer vector with same length as the number of
  rows of the input, and all values from 1 to the specified number of
  clusters).

One of the two functions should be implmented in C/C++ code with an
Rcpp interface. For examples see the aum_sort and aum_map C/C++
functions in my [[https://github.com/tdhock/aum][aum]] package.
- src/your_algo.h should define a function prototype and return/error
  status codes. Use different positive integer values to indicate
  different types of errors.
- src/your_algo.cpp should define a standard (non-Rcpp) C/C++ function
  which returns an integer status code (0 for success, errors as
  defined in your header file). It should use standard (non-Rcpp) types
  as input arguments, for example double* to pass the data, and int to
  pass the length of the data.
- src/interface.cpp should have an interface function with
  input/output Rcpp types, and which calls the function you defined in
  src/your_algo.cpp. This file should contain declarations,
  #+begin_src C++
  #include <Rcpp.h>
  #include "your_algo.h"
  // [[Rcpp::export]]
  #+end_src
- Don't forget to run =Rcpp::compileAttributes("path/to/yourPkg")=
  which looks for the exported functions in yourPkg/src/*.cpp and
  writes corresponding files: =yourPkg/src/RcppExports.cpp= and
  =yourPkg/R/RcppExports.R= (which are required to use your C++ code).

You need to upload your code to a GitHub repository (you need a free
GitHub account so please create one if you don't have one yet). Your
repo should NOT include any files except source code/docs/tests/etc
required to build the package (e.g. you will get minus points if there
is a .Rhistory file, or compiled binary *.o *.so *.dll files, in your github repo).

You need to setup [[https://orchid00.github.io/actions_sandbox/packageci.html#actions-for-continuous-integration-checks][GitHub Actions for continuous integration checks]] of
your R package. This will run the standard package checks, and your
tests, every time you push new commits to GitHub. Make sure that your
package passes checks with no WARNINGs and no ERRORs (but NOTEs are
OK).

You should write a README.md or README.org file that includes at least
two sections (1) Installation which explains how to install your
package via remotes::install_github("username/repo") and (2) Usage
which shows a few lines of R code about how to use your package (can
be same as examples).

Please upload a PDF with
- a link to your github repository,
  e.g. https://github.com/tdhock/nc
- a link to your most recent GitHub Actions run, 
  e.g. https://github.com/tdhock/nc/actions/runs/1062594950
- code/results from the R terminal from running examples for your
  functions. e.g. example("KMEANS", package="yourPkg") + results.
